\item Let $A$,$B$,$C$,$D$ be four distinct points on a line, in that order. The circles with diameters $AC$ and $BD$ intersect at $X$ and $Y$. The line $XY$ meets $BC$ at $Z$. Let $P$ be a point on the line $XY$ other than $Z$. The line $CP$ intersects the circle with diameter $AC$ at $C$ and $M$, and the line $BP$ intersects the circle with diameter $BD$ at $B$ and $N$. Prove that the lines $AM$, $DN$, $XY$ are concurrent.
\item Let $a$, $b$, $c$ be positive real numbers such that $abc=1$. Prove that \\ 
\begin{align*}	
\frac{1}{a^3(b+c)}+\frac{1}{b^3(c+a)}+\frac{1}{c^3(a+b)}\geq\frac{3}{2}.
\end{align*}
\item Determine all integers $n>3$ for which there exist $n$ points $A_1\dots,A_n$ in the plane, no three collinear, and real numbers $r_1,\dots,r_n$ such that for $1\leq{i}<{j}<{k}\leq{n}$, the area of $\triangle A_iA_jA_k$ is $r_i+r_j+r_k$.
\item Find the maximum value of $x_{0}$ for which there exists a sequence $x_{0},x_{1}\dots x_{1995}$ of positive reals with $x_{0}=x_{1995}$, such that for $i=1,\dots,1995$,
\begin{align*}
x_{i-1}+\frac{2}{x_{i-1}}=2x_i+\frac{1}{x_i}. 
\end{align*}
\item Let $ABCDEF$ be a convex hexagon with $AB=BC=CD$ and $DE=EF=FA$, such that $\angle{BCD}=\angle{EFA}=\frac{\pi}{3}$. Suppose $G$ and $H$ are points in the interior of the hexagon such that $\angle{AGB}=\angle{DHE}=\frac{2\pi}{3}$. Prove that $AG+GB+GH+DH+HE\geq CF$.
\item Let $p$ be an odd prime number. How many p-element subsets $A$ of $\{1,2,....2p\}$ are there, the sum of whose elements is divisible by $p$?
