\item In the plane the points with integer coordinates are the vertices of unit squares. The squares are colored alternately black and white (as on a chessboard).\\                     For any pair of positive integers $m$ and $n$, consider a right-angled triangle whose vertices have integer coordinates and whose legs, of lengths $m$ and $n$, lie along edges of the squares.\\                              Let $S_1$ be the total area of the black part of triangle ans $S_2$ be the total area of white part. Let
\begin{align}
f(m,n)=\mydet{S_1-S_2}.            
\end{align}                        
\begin{enumerate}                   
\item calculate $f(m,n)$ for all positive integers $m$ and $n$ which are either both even or both odd.
\item Prove that $f(m,n) \leq \frac{1}{2}max\cbrak{m,n}$ for all $m$ and $n$.
\item Show that there is no constant $C$ such that $f(m,n)<c$ for all $m$ and $n$.
\end{enumerate}
\item The angle at $A$ is the smallest angle of triangle $ABC$. The point $B$ and $C$ divide the circumcircle of the triangle into two arcs. Let $U$ be an interior point of the arc between $B$ and $C$ which does not contain $A$. The perpendicular bisectors of $AB$ and $AC$ meet the line $AU$ at $V$ and $W$, respctively. The lines $BV$ and $CW$ meet at $T$. Show that 
\begin{align}
AU=TB+TC.
\end{align}
\item Let ${x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n}$ be the real numbers satisfying the conditions 
\begin{align}
\mydet{x_1+x_2+\dots+x_n}=1
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}
\mydet{x_i}\leq\frac{n+1}{2}      {i=1,2,\dots,n}.
\end{align}
Show that there exists a permutation ${y_1, y_2,\dots,y_n}$ of ${x_1, x_2,\dots,x_n}$ such that
\begin{align}
\mydet{y_1+2y_2+\dots+ny_n}\leq\frac{n+1}{2}.
\end{align}
\item A $n\times n$ matrix whose entires come from the set $S = \cbrak{1,2,\dots,2n-1}$ is called a silver matrix if, for each ${i=1,2,\dots,n,}$ the ith row and ith column together contain all elements of $S$. Show that 
\begin{enumerate}
\item there is no silver matrix for $n=1997$;
\item silver matrices exist for infinitely many values of $n$.
\end{enumerate}
\item Find all pairs $(a,b)$ of integers $a,b \geq 1$ that satisfy the equation 
\begin{align}
a^{b^2}=b^{a}.
\end{align}
\item For each positive integer $n$, let $f(n)$ denote the number of ways of representing $n$ as a sum of powers of $2$ with nonnegative integer exponents. Representations which differ only in the ordering of their of their summands are considered to be the same. For instance, $f(4)=4$, because the number $4$ can be represented in the following four ways;
\begin{align}
4;2 + 2;2 + 1 + 1;1 + 1 + 1 + 1.
\end{align}
Prove that, for any integer $n \geq{3}$,
\begin{align}
2^{n^2/4} < f(2^n)<2^{n^2/2}.
\end{align}
\end{enumerate}
