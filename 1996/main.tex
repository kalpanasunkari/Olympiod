\item  We are given a positive interger $r$ and a rectangular board $ABCD$ with dimensions $\mydet{AB} =20$, $\mydet{BC}=12$. The rectangle is divided into a grid of $20\times12$ unit squares. The following moves are permitted on the board: one can move from one square to another only if the distance between the centers of the two squares is $\sqrt{r}$. The task is to find a sequence of moves leading from the square with $A$ as a vertex to the square with $B$ as a vertex.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that the task cannot be done if $r$ is divisible by $2$ or $3$.
\item Prove that the task is possible when $r=73$.
\item Can the task be done when $r=97$?
\end{enumerate}
\item Let $P$ be a point inside triangle $ABC$ such that
\begin{align*}
\angle{APB}-\angle{ACB}=\angle{APC}-\angle{ABC}.
\end{align*}
Let $D$, $E$ be the incenters of triangles $APB$ ,$APC$, respectively. Show that $AP$ ,$BD$, $CE$ meet at a point.
\item Let $S$ denote the set of nonnegative integers. Find all functions $f$ from $s$ to itself such that 
\begin{align*}
f(m+f(n))=f(f(m))+f(n)         
\forall{m}, n \epsilon S. 
\end{align*}
\item The positive integers $a$ and $b$ are such that the numbers $15a+16b$ and $16a-15b$ are both squares of positive integers. What is the least possible value that can be taken on by the smaller of these two squares?
\item Let $ABCDEF$ be a convex hexagon such that $AB$ is parallel to $DE$, $BC$ is parallel to $EF$, and $CD$ is parallel to $FA$. Let $R_A$, $R_C$, $R_E$ denote the circumradii of triangles $FAB$, $BCD$, $DEF$, respectively, and let $P$ denote the perimeter of the hexagon. Prove that
\begin{align*}
R_A+R_C+R_E\geq\frac{p}{2}.
\end{align*}
\item Let $p$, $q$, $n$ be three positive integers with $p+q<n$. Let $(x_0, x_1,....,x_n)$ be an $(n+1)$-tuple of integers satisfying the following conditons:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $x_0=x_n=0$.
\item For each $i$ with $1\leq{i}\leq{n}$, either $x_i-x_{i-1}=p$ or $x_i-x_{i-1}=-q$.\\ 
Show that there exist indices $i < j$ with $(i,j) \neq(0,n)$, such that $x_i=x_j$.
